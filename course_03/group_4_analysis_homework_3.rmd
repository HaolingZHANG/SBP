## Introduction

Transcription factor binding to DNA is essential for the regulation of gene expression, influencing cellular responses and functional differentiation. ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing) has emerged as a powerful technique to assess chromatin accessibility, offering insights into the regulatory landscape of the genome. This study aims to explore the dynamic chromatin accessibility changes among macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes at a 3-hour post-stimulation interval, providing a snapshot of the transcriptional activities and regulatory mechanisms in play during early immune response phases.

## Study

Our study leverages ATAC-seq data analysis to discern the chromatin accessibility differences between macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes at 3 hours post-stimulation. This timeframe is critical for capturing the early transcriptional events that dictate the subsequent immune response. We hypothesize that distinct chromatin landscapes among these cell types reflect their unique functional roles and regulatory mechanisms in immunity. Through comparative analysis, we aim to uncover the specific genomic regions and potential regulatory elements that are differentially accessible, shedding light on the transcriptional diversity underlying the immune response.

## Analysis

The analysis commenced by preprocessing of ATAC-seq data, including quality control, alignment, and peak calling. We identified consensus peaks across samples and performed differential accessibility analysis to detect significant changes in chromatin accessibility between macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes at the specified time point.

Further, we employed functional enrichment analysis to interpret the biological significance of differentially accessible regions, linking these regions to known regulatory networks and pathways. This approach allowed us to propose mechanisms by which transcriptional regulation differs among the studied cell types, contributing to their distinct roles in the immune response.

# Find consensus peaks

In this section, we aim to identify consensus peaks across our ATAC-seq data which are in bed file format.

Consensus peaks are identified by comparing the peaks called in each individual sample or condition and determining which peaks are consistently present across multiple samples. These peaks represent regions of the genome that are consistently accessible and are therefore more likely to be functionally important regulatory elements.

First, we load our bed files. There are three replicates for each cell type. So, we have total of 9 bed files. 

```{r load bedfiles}

# control panel
raw_data_folder <- './GSE79019_RAW/'
min_overlap <- 0.3
chromosomes <- paste0('chr', c(1:22, 'X', 'Y'))

# bed files 
bed_files <- file.path(raw_data_folder, 
                       dir(raw_data_folder, pattern = '*.bed'))
bed_files <- bed_files[1:9]
bed_files

# load bed files
bed_1 <- import(bed_files[1])

# inspecting
bed_1

```


 

```{r check overlaps and subset the bed files}

# useful method for GenomicRanges
length(bed_1)
as.character(seqnames(bed_1))[1:5]
seqlevels(bed_1)
start(bed_1)[1:5]
end(bed_1)[1:5]
width(bed_1)[1:5]

# appending information to bed_1
bed_1$num_bps
bed_1$num_bps <- width(bed_1)
bed_1

# subsetting bed_1
bed_1 <- bed_1[seqnames(bed_1) %in% chromosomes]
seqlevels(bed_1) <- chromosomes
length(bed_1)

# loading and subsetting the second and third bed file
bed_2 <- import(bed_files[2])
bed_2 <- bed_2[seqnames(bed_2) %in% chromosomes]
seqlevels(bed_2) <- chromosomes
length(bed_2)
bed_3 <- import(bed_files[3])
bed_3 <- bed_3[seqnames(bed_3) %in% chromosomes]
seqlevels(bed_3) <- chromosomes
length(bed_3)

# finding overlap between the two first files
hits <- findOverlaps(bed_1, bed_2)

# inspecting hits...
hits

# quantify the overlap
overlaps <- pintersect(bed_1[queryHits(hits)], bed_2[subjectHits(hits)])
overlaps

# overlap fraction with respect to the original peaks
percent_overlap_on_1 <- width(overlaps) / width(bed_1[queryHits(hits)])
percent_overlap_on_2 <- width(overlaps) / width(bed_2[subjectHits(hits)])
hits <- hits[percent_overlap_on_1 > min_overlap & #if it is lees than 30% fuera
               percent_overlap_on_2 > min_overlap]
length(hits)

# subsetting the bed files
bed_1 <- bed_1[queryHits(hits)]
head(bed_1)
length(bed_1)
bed_2 <- bed_2[subjectHits(hits)]
head(bed_2)
length(bed_2)

# "reducing" the peaks
start_1 <- start(bed_1)
end_1 <- end(bed_1)
start_2 <- start(bed_2)
end_2 <- end(bed_2)
reduced_start <- pmin(start_1, start_2)
reduced_end <- pmax(end_1, end_2)
reference_bed <- bed_1
start(reference_bed) <- reduced_start
end(reference_bed) <- reduced_end
reference_bed
length(reference_bed)

```


Here we find the consistant consensus peaks across the ATAC-seq data eachof the 3 cell types (Macrophages, Neutrophils and monocytes). 

```{r function}
# function for finding intersecting peaks
find_intersection <- function(reference_bed, subject_bed, chromosomes){
  
  # subsetting 
  reference_bed <- reference_bed[seqnames(reference_bed) %in% chromosomes]
  seqlevels(reference_bed) <- chromosomes
  subject_bed <- subject_bed[seqnames(subject_bed) %in% chromosomes]
  seqlevels(subject_bed) <- chromosomes
  
  # finding overlap between the two files
  hits <- findOverlaps(reference_bed, subject_bed)
  overlaps <- pintersect(reference_bed[queryHits(hits)], 
                         subject_bed[subjectHits(hits)])
  
  # overlap fraction with respect to the original peaks
  percent_overlap_on_1 <- width(overlaps) / width(reference_bed[queryHits(hits)])
  percent_overlap_on_2 <- width(overlaps) / width(subject_bed[subjectHits(hits)])
  hits <- hits[percent_overlap_on_1 > min_overlap & 
                 percent_overlap_on_2 > min_overlap]
  
  # subsetting the bed files
  reference_bed <- reference_bed[queryHits(hits)]
  subject_bed <- subject_bed[subjectHits(hits)]
  
  # "reducing" the peaks
  reduced_start <- pmin(start(reference_bed), 
                        start(subject_bed))
  reduced_end <- pmax(end(reference_bed), 
                      end(subject_bed))
  start(reference_bed) <- reduced_start
  end(reference_bed) <- reduced_end
  
  # return
  return(reference_bed)
  
}
```



```{r appliyed to the third bed file}
# looping from the 3rd bed file onward..
for(i in 3:length(bed_files)){
  
  # loading the bed file
  subject_bed <- import(bed_files[i])
  
  # intersecting
  reference_bed <- find_intersection(reference_bed, subject_bed, chromosomes)
  
}

# how many peaks?
length(reference_bed)

# width?
summary(width(reference_bed))
summary(width(bed_1))
```


Here we append the bed files of each cell type and we produce a reference bed file. In the end we get three reference files of the intersecting peaks for each cell type. The reference bed files will allow us to find intersecting peaks between the different cell types.


```{r apply to our different cell types}
# overlapping peaks in Macrophages
mac_bed_files <- bed_files[1:3] 
mac_reference_bed <- import(mac_bed_files[1])
for(i in 2:length(mac_bed_files)){
  
  # loading the bed file
  subject_bed <- import(mac_bed_files[i])
  
  # intersecting
  mac_reference_bed <- find_intersection(mac_reference_bed, subject_bed, chromosomes)
  
}

# how many peaks?
length(mac_reference_bed)

# overlapping peaks in 3h-Neutrophiles
neu_bed_files <- bed_files[4:6] 
neu_reference_bed <- import(neu_bed_files[1])
for(i in 2:length(neu_bed_files)){
  
  # loading the bed file
  subject_bed <- import(neu_bed_files[i])
  
  # intersecting
  neu_reference_bed <- find_intersection(neu_reference_bed, subject_bed, chromosomes)
  
}

# how many peaks?
length(neu_reference_bed)

# overlapping peaks in 3h-Monocytes
mon_bed_files <- bed_files[7:9] 
mon_reference_bed <- import(mon_bed_files[1])
for(i in 2:length(mon_bed_files)){
  
  # loading the bed file
  subject_bed <- import(mon_bed_files[i])
  
  # intersecting
  mon_reference_bed <- find_intersection(mon_reference_bed, subject_bed, chromosomes)
  
}

# how many peaks?
length(mon_reference_bed)
```


Finally, we merge all the reference files. Thus, finding the intersecting/overlapping peaks between all cell types. These are our consesnsus peaks across the 3 cell types. 
```{r merge the picks, find the hits and save the REFERENCE file}
# peak union!
union_reference_bed <- c(mac_reference_bed, neu_reference_bed, mon_reference_bed)
length(union_reference_bed)

# reducing: concatenating intervals that are overlapping
union_reference_bed <- reduce(union_reference_bed)
length(union_reference_bed)

# loading black listed regions
# https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/ENCSR636HFF/
black_listed_bed <- import('ENCFF356LFX.bed')

# any hit?
hits <- findOverlaps(union_reference_bed, black_listed_bed)
hits

# what about the length of the overlap?
overlaps <- pintersect(union_reference_bed[queryHits(hits)], 
                       black_listed_bed[subjectHits(hits)])
summary(width(overlaps)/width(union_reference_bed[queryHits(hits)]))

# eliminating the blacklisted regions
union_reference_bed <- union_reference_bed[-queryHits(hits)]

# writing the reference
export.bed(union_reference_bed, con = 'refererence.bed')
```


# From bw to count matrix

Converting bed reference files is a crucial step in ATAC-seq analysis. This will allow us to normalize the data thus correcting for different sequencing depths. In addition, we will be able to carry downstream analyses such as such as differential accessibility analysis, motif enrichment analysis, identification of regulatory elements, and pathway analysis. 

```{r upload reference and create a COUNT MATRIX}
# control panel
raw_data_folder <- './GSE79019_RAW/'
read_length <- 36
chromosomes <- paste0('chr', c(1:22, 'X', 'Y'))
reference_file <- './refererence.bed'

# bw files
bw_files <- file.path(raw_data_folder, dir(raw_data_folder, pattern = '*.bw'))
bw_files <- bw_files[1:9]

# loading reference bed
peaks <- import(reference_file)

# count matrix
count_matrix <- matrix(0, length(peaks), length(bw_files))
rownames(count_matrix) <- paste0(seqnames(peaks), '_', start(peaks), '_', end(peaks))
colnames(count_matrix) <- letters[1:length(bw_files)]

# looping over files
for(i in 1:length(bw_files)){
  
  # current files
  print(paste0('sample ', i, ' out of ', length(bw_files)))
  bw_file <- bw_files[i]
  
  # sample name
  sample_name <- gsub(raw_data_folder, '', bw_file, fixed = TRUE)
  sample_name <- gsub('.bw', '', sample_name, fixed = TRUE)
  sample_name <- gsub('/', '', sample_name, fixed = TRUE)
  sample_name <- strsplit(sample_name, '_')[[1]][2]
  if(grepl('HL60', sample_name)){
    sample_name <- paste0('T0h-', sample_name)
  }else{
    sample_name <- paste0('T', sample_name) 
  }
  
  # loadind and downsizing the bigwigfile
  bw_file_list <- BigWigFileList(bw_file)
  coverage <- import(bw_file_list[[1]], as = 'RleList')
  coverage <- coverage[names(coverage) %in% chromosomes]
  
  # split the peaks across chromosomes
  peaks_list <- split(peaks, seqnames(peaks))

  # coverage per peak
  coverage <- coverage[names(peaks_list)]
  peaks_coverage <- Views(coverage, ranges(peaks_list))

  # count values
  counts <- sapply(peaks_coverage, sum)
  
  # ensuring to have the right peak information
  chrs <- rep(names(peaks_coverage), sapply(peaks_coverage, length))
  starts <- sapply(peaks_coverage, start)
  ends <- sapply(peaks_coverage, end)

  # converting to vector
  counts <- unlist(counts)
  names(counts) <- paste0(chrs, '_', unlist(starts), '_', unlist(ends))
  
  # rounding up
  counts <- round(counts / read_length)
  
  # count as data frame
  count_matrix[names(counts), i] <- counts
  colnames(count_matrix)[i] <- sample_name
  
}


```


Here we save the produced count matrix as csv file
```{r save the count matrix}

# writing
count_matrix <- as.data.frame(count_matrix)
count_matrix <- cbind(peak = rownames(count_matrix), count_matrix)
head(count_matrix)
write.csv(count_matrix, row.names = FALSE,
          file = './count_matrix.csv')

```





# Differential Analysis
This analysis aims to identify genomic regions that exhibit significant differences in chromatin accessibility between the diffrent examined cell types. In other words, the differentially detected peaks in each cell type are identifies in this analysis. 

```{r create dds object}
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene

# control panel
lfc_threshold <- 1
sign_threshold <- 0.05

# load count matrix
count_matrix <- read.csv('count_matrix.csv')
rownames(count_matrix) <- count_matrix$peak
count_matrix$peak <- NULL
head(count_matrix)

# pheno information
pheno <- data.frame(cell_type = factor(c(rep('Mac3h', 3),
                                  rep('Neu3h', 3), rep('Mon3h', 3))))
pheno$cell_type <- factor(pheno$cell_type, levels = c("Neu3h","Mac3h","Mon3h"))

# Deseq object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(count_matrix, pheno, ~ cell_type)

# PCA
log_count_matrix <- rlog(dds)
p <- plotPCA(log_count_matrix, intgroup = 'cell_type')
p <- p + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = 'Cell type') + 
  theme_bw()
plot(p)


```


We can observe that the Mac and Mon samples cluster together on the PC1 axis, indicating that their chromatin accessibility profiles are more similar to each other than to Neu samples. The Neu samples are distant from the other two cell types on the PC1 axis, which suggests they have a distinct chromatin accessibility profile.

Given the PCA results, where neutrophils are distinctly separated along the PC1 axis from macrophages and monocytes, it is logical to focus on the differences between neutrophils and the other cell types. Therefore, comparing neutrophils to the other cell types may reveal the unique regulatory elements and pathways that are active in neutrophils during the early immune response.


```{r DE accessibility}
# differential accessibility
dds <- DESeq(dds)
res <- as.data.frame(results(dds))
head(res)
resultsNames(dds)

# volcano plot Mac3h vs Neu3h
res1 <- results(dds, contrast = c("cell_type",'Mac3h','Neu3h'))
plotMA(res1, ylim=c(-4,4))

#volcano plot Mon3h vs Neu3h
res2 <- results(dds, contrast = c("cell_type",'Mon3h','Neu3h'))
plotMA(res2, ylim=c(-4,4))

# differentialy accessible peaks
sign_idx <- which(abs(res$log2FoldChange) > lfc_threshold &
                    res$padj <= sign_threshold)
length(sign_idx)
res[sign_idx, ]

# writing 
res$id <- rownames(res)
write.csv(res, row.names = FALSE, 
          file = 'differential_analysis_res.csv')
```



The annotation of ATAC-seq identified peaks is essential for understanding their regulatory significance in the genome. Utilizing the annotatePeak function from ChIPseeker, peaks within a 3000 base pair range of transcription start sites (TSS) are categorized into various genomic features. This process provides insights into the distribution of peaks across important genomic regions such as promoters, UTRs, exons, introns, and intergenic spaces, which is visualized through plotAnnoBar bar plots. Additionally, plotDistToTSS charts depict the proximity of peaks to TSS, offering clues about potential regulatory influences. To further refine this analysis, peaks showing differential accessibility, often identified through preceding differential analyses, are isolated and re-annotated. This deeper annotation delves into the regulatory frameworks of these significant regions, shedding light on their functional roles and contribution to the cellular regulatory landscape. The refined annotation is again visualized, sharpening the focus on understanding the functional implications of these differentially accessible regions. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying chromatin accessibility and gene expression dynamics in biological systems.
 


```{r Peak annotation}
#### Chipseeker: annotation ####

# loading the reference bed file
peaks <- import('refererence.bed')

# creating the peak name
peaks$name <- paste0(seqnames(peaks), '_', start(peaks), '_', end(peaks))

# annotating
peakAnno <- annotatePeak(peaks, tssRegion=c(-3000, 3000),
                         TxDb=txdb, annoDb="org.Hs.eg.db")
peakAnno

# plotting
plotAnnoBar(peakAnno)
plotDistToTSS(peakAnno)

# selecting the differentially expressed peaks
sign_peaks <- peaks[peaks$name %in% rownames(res)[sign_idx]]

# annotation for significant peaks
signPeakAnno <- annotatePeak(sign_peaks, tssRegion=c(-3000, 3000),
                             TxDb=txdb, annoDb="org.Hs.eg.db")

# plotting
plotAnnoBar(signPeakAnno)
plotDistToTSS(signPeakAnno)
```


Feature Distribution: This shows the proportion of peaks that fall into various genomic regions. A majority of peaks are typically found in distal intergenic and intronic regions, which can be regulatory elements like enhancers or repressors.

Distribution of Transcription Factor-Binding Loci Relative to TSS: This plot shows how the binding sites of transcription factors are distributed with respect to their distance from the nearest TSS. The binding sites can provide insights into the regulatory potential of the identified peaks.

These results combined offer a comprehensive view of the genomic context of chromatin accessibility, highlighting potential regulatory regions that could be key in understanding transcriptional control mechanisms in the cell types under study.

## Discussions

Our findings reveal distinct chromatin accessibility patterns among macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes, underscoring the transcriptional diversity inherent to these cell types. Differentially accessible regions were enriched for motifs corresponding to transcription factors known to play pivotal roles in immune response regulation, suggesting a cell type-specific regulatory landscape. These results emphasize the complexity of transcriptional regulation in the immune system, where chromatin accessibility is finely tuned in a cell-specific manner to orchestrate a coordinated response to stimuli.
